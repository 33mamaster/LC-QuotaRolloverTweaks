# QuotaRolloverTweaks
 QuotaRollover tweaks mod for Lethal Company. Inspired by the QuotaRollover mod by boxofbiscuits97.

 This mod aims to be an extension of QuotaRollover, allowing for a more balanced and configurable experience over the original mod.

 Create a Github issue or ping me (name is set as 33) in the modding discord if you find a bug.

## Added configurable features:
- Only consider new scrap for Quota Overtime
	- This prevents you getting free Overtime bonus from the rolled over quota
	- Default: `Enabled`
- Remove Overtime Bonus entirely by setting it to 0
	- Default: `Disabled`
- Remove fulfilled quota on a party wipe.
	- This is similar to when everyone dies and you lose all scrap in the ship
	- Default: `Enabled`

## Planned features:
- Option to make team wipe only remove a percentage of the fulfilled quota
	- Remove a percentage of the fulfilled quota instead of setting to 0
