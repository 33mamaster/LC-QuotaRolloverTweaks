# LC-QuotaRolloverTweaks
 QuotaRollover tweaks mod for Lethal Company. Inspired by the QuotaRollover mod by boxofbiscuits97.

 This mod aims to be an extension of QuotaRollover, allowing for a more balanced and configurable experience over the original mod.


## Added configurable features:
- Only consider new scrap for Quota Overtime
	- Default: Enabled
- Remove Overtime Bonus entirely by setting it to 0
	- Default: Disabled
- Remove fulfilled quota on a party wipe.
	- This is similar to when everyone dies and you lose all scrap in the ship
	- Default: Enabled

## Planned features:
- Option to make team wipe only remove a percentage of the fulfilled quota
	- Remove a percentage of the fulfilled quota instead of setting to 0


## Changelog
