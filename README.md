# LC-QuotaRolloverTweaks
 QuotaRollover tweaks mod for Lethal Company. Inspired by the QuotaRollover mod by boxofbiscuits97.

 This mod aims to be an extension of QuotaRollover, allowing for a more balanced and configurable experience over the original mod.


## Added configurable features:
- Only consider new scrap for Quota Overtime
	- Default: Enabled
- Set Overtime Bonus to 0
	- Default: Disabled

## Planned features:
- Option to change team wipe to remove some existing quota
	- Team wipes normally removes all scrap. Why not remove some quota as a replacement, since all scrap is sold?!
	- Punishment mechanic if QuotaRollover feels too safe


## Changelog
- v1.0.0
	- Initial Release
